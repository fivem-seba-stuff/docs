# Introduction

**Seba FiveM Docs Hub** is a comprehensive documentation site for FiveM/RedM scripts and resources. This hub provides detailed guides, API references, and implementation examples for essential scripts including Ox Lib v4.0.0, OxMySQL, Ox Inventory, Ox Target, and Ox Doorlock.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

This documentation hub builds upon the excellent work of:

- **Overextended Team** - The original creators and maintainers of these high-quality FiveM resources (2021-2025). Their dedication to providing free, open-source, performance-focused scripts has been fundamental to the FiveM community.

- **Community Ox** - The organization that took over maintaining forks of most Overextended resources after the original team archived their work, continuing their mission of providing free, open-source, high-quality resources for the community.

All scripts maintain their original open-source licensing and focus on performance, stability, and security. This documentation serves as a centralized resource for developers and server owners looking to implement and customize these powerful FiveM tools.

If you feel like our documentation is lacking, please let us know or suggest improvements by using the links in the sidebar.

## Maintainers

## Legacy team (2021-2025)

Overextended was a team of hobbyists and professional developers who collaborated between 2021 and 2025 to create high-quality, open-source resources for the FiveM community. Their work focused on performance, stability, and security â€” often involving complex projects that required a significant amount of time and dedication.

Although the team is no longer active, their contributions continue to support and inspire the community. If you'd like to show appreciation for their past work, you can do so below.
